# MCpal Bedrock - A lightweight Minecraft Server manager :)

## What does it do?
- Automatic backups once a day (currently at 4am)
- Extendes features (while fully supporting the native commands) like manual backups
- It's possible to automatically run other custom commands after each backup

## Install & Run:
1. Download "MCpal.jar"
2. Move it into your minecraft server directory
3. Open a console window and jump to the specific server directory (example: cd /home/Potato/minecraft_server/)
4. Now run "java -jar MCpal.jar b:PATH_TO_BACKUP_FOLDER
Example: java -jar MCpal.jar b:C:/Users/Potato/mc_backups
5. (Optional) A config file will be generated, which means that from now on you can call "java -jar MCpal.jar" after the first run. You no longer need to provide the other commands.

## Usage
In your terminal, where you actually run MCPal, just type:
- `backup`: To start a backup (including 10 seconds countdown)
- `stop`: To stop the server (including 10 seconds countdown)
- `istop`: To immediately stop the server
- `start`: To start the server

Other than that, the console will be the usual minecraft server console. You can interact with it like with any other console.
